            <li><strong>Floods:</strong> Floods can be caused by heavy rain, storm surge, or the failure of infrastructure such as levees or dams.</li>
            <li><strong>Wildfires:</strong> Wildfires can be caused by lightning strikes or human activity and can cause significant damage to forests, homes, and other structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Tornadoes:</strong> Tornadoes are violent windstorms that can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic eruptions:</strong> Volcanic eruptions can cause significant damage to infrastructure and property, as well as pose health risks due to the release of ash, gas, and lava.</li>
