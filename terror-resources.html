        <h2>What is the terrorism threat level system?</h2>
        <p>The terrorism threat level system is a way for the government to communicate the likelihood of a terrorist attack in a particular area. The system uses a color-coded scale with five levels, ranging from low to severe.</p>
        <p>The terrorism threat level is determined by a variety of factors, including intelligence information, the overall global threat picture, and specific threat information regarding the United States.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What do the different threat levels mean?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low:</strong> A terrorist attack is unlikely.</li>
            <li><strong>Guarded:</strong> A terrorist attack is possible, but not likely.</li>
            <li><strong>Elevated:</strong> A terrorist attack is credible and likely.</li>
            <li><strong>High:</strong> A terrorist attack is highly likely.</li>
            <li><strong>Severe:</strong> A terrorist attack is imminent or has occurred.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>What should you do?</h2>
        <p>When the terrorism threat level is elevated, high, or severe, you should be prepared for the possibility of a terrorist attack. This includes being aware of your surroundings, reporting any suspicious activity to law enforcement, and having an emergency plan in place.</p>
        <p>If an attack occurs, you should follow the instructions of law enforcement and emergency personnel. If you are in a public place, you should try to find a safe location and stay there until it is safe to leave.</p>
